# Analyzing-Social-Networks-using-GraphFrame
Analyze Social Network Data using Spark GraphFrames

Load the data into a GraphFrame or RDD using Spark and run the following queries:
a. Find the top 5 nodes with the highest outdegree and find the count of the number of outgoing edges in each node
b. Find the top 5 nodes with the highest indegree and find the count of the number of incoming edges in each node
c. Calculate PageRank for each of the nodes and output the top 5 nodes with the highest PageRank values. You are free to define any suitable parameters.
d. Run the connected components algorithm on it and find the top 5 components with the largest number of nodes.
e. Run the triangle counts algorithm on each of the vertices and output the top 5 vertices with the largest triangle count. In case of ties, you can randomly select the top 5 vertices.

Outputs are printed in notebook.
