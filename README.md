Analyze Social Network Data using Spark GraphFrames
\n
Load the data into a GraphFrame or RDD using Spark and run the following queries: \n
a. Find the top 5 nodes with the highest outdegree and find the count of the number of outgoing edges in each node \n
b. Find the top 5 nodes with the highest indegree and find the count of the number of incoming edges in each node \n
c. Calculate PageRank for each of the nodes and output the top 5 nodes with the highest PageRank values. You are free to define any suitable parameters. \n
d. Run the connected components algorithm on it and find the top 5 components with the largest number of nodes. \n
e. Run the triangle counts algorithm on each of the vertices and output the top 5 vertices with the largest triangle count. In case of ties, you can randomly select the top 5 vertices. \n
\n
Outputs are printed in notebook.
