Analyze Social Network Data using Spark GraphFrames
<br>
Load the data into a GraphFrame or RDD using Spark and run the following queries: <br>
a. Find the top 5 nodes with the highest outdegree and find the count of the number of outgoing edges in each node <br>
b. Find the top 5 nodes with the highest indegree and find the count of the number of incoming edges in each node <br>
c. Calculate PageRank for each of the nodes and output the top 5 nodes with the highest PageRank values. You are free to define any suitable parameters. <br>
d. Run the connected components algorithm on it and find the top 5 components with the largest number of nodes. <br>
e. Run the triangle counts algorithm on each of the vertices and output the top 5 vertices with the largest triangle count. In case of ties, you can randomly select the top 5 vertices. <br>
<br>
Outputs are printed in notebook.
